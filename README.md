# Groundwater Level Prediction System

This project is a machine learning-based application designed to predict groundwater levels in various Indian states based on seasonal and environmental factors. It includes data preparation, model training, and an interactive Streamlit web application for predictions and analysis.

## 📋 Project Overview

The system uses a Random Forest Regressor to predict groundwater depth (in meters below ground level) based on:
- **Location**: Indian State/Union Territory
- **Season**: Winter, Pre-Monsoon, Monsoon, Post-Monsoon
- **Environmental Factors**: Rainfall, Temperature, pH, Dissolved Oxygen

Key features include:
- **Interactive Web App**: Built with Streamlit for easy user interaction.
- **Crop Recommendations**: Suggests suitable crops based on predicted water levels.
- **Historical Comparison**: Compares predictions with historical data from 2023.
- **Analysis Reports**: Generates insights on water safety levels (Safe, Semi-Critical, Critical).

## 🛠️ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (if applicable) or navigate to the project directory.

2.  **Set up a virtual environment** (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 🚀 Usage Workflow

Follow these steps to run the project from scratch:

### 1. Data Preparation
The project uses a dataset `DWLR_Dataset_2023.csv`. You can generate/modify this dataset to include realistic location-based patterns.

```bash
python modify_dataset.py
```
*This script adds a 'Location' attribute and adjusts 'Water_Level_m' to create realistic correlations between states, seasons, and groundwater levels.*

### 2. Model Training
Train the machine learning model using the prepared dataset.

```bash
python train_simple_model.py
```
*This script trains a Random Forest Regressor, evaluates it, and saves the model (`simple_rf_model.pkl`) and feature columns (`model_columns.pkl`) for the app to use.*

### 3. Run the Application
Launch the Streamlit web interface.

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
*This will open the application in your default web browser (usually at `http://localhost:8501`).*

## 📂 File Descriptions

### Core Files
- **`app.py`**: The main Streamlit application. Handles user input, loads the model, and displays predictions, analysis, and charts.
- **`train_simple_model.py`**: Script to train the Random Forest model. It handles data preprocessing (one-hot encoding) and model serialization.
- **`modify_dataset.py`**: Utility to preprocess the raw CSV data, adding state-specific logic and seasonal adjustments to the water levels.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of Python libraries required for the project.

### Analysis & Research Scripts
These scripts are for advanced analysis and are not required for the main app workflow:
- **`groundwater_analysis.py`**: Performs advanced modeling using Stacking, Voting, and Gradient Boosting methods to optimize predictions.
- **`classification_analysis.py`**: Analyzes the data as a classification problem (Safe vs. Critical) and compares multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, RF, XGBoost, MLP).
- **`ensemble_analysis.py`**: Focuses on ensemble methods.
- **`prophet_analysis.py`**: (Likely) Time-series forecasting using Facebook Prophet.

### Data & Models
- **`DWLR_Dataset_2023.csv`**: The dataset containing groundwater level records.
- **`simple_rf_model.pkl`**: The trained Random Forest model file.
- **`model_columns.pkl`**: List of feature columns used during training (required for consistent prediction).

## 📊 Analysis Outputs
The analysis scripts generate various plots and reports, such as:
- `optimized_groundwater_prediction.png`
- `model_comparison.png`
- `decision_tree_viz.png`
- `classification_report.txt`
